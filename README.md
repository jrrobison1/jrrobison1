# Hey there, I'm Jason Robison! ðŸ‘‹

## NLP Enthusiast | LLM Explorer | Fantasy Reader | Hiker

Welcome to my GitHub playground! I'm all about building on the world of natural language processing and large language models. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me lost in a Brandon Sanderson novel or hiking some scenic trails. 

### What I'm up to:
- Working on [pycidr](https://github.com/jrrobison1/pycpidr), a propositional idea density rater based on CPIDR 3.2
- Exploring how LLMs "experience" aesthetics with my [writing-feature-extractor](https://github.com/jrrobison1/writing-feature-extractor)
- Re-reading the Stormlight Archive series (Sanderson fans, unite)

### ðŸ’» Tech I love:

```python
tech_stack = ["Python", "Langchain", "TypeScript", "Java"]
current_mood = "Excited about the future"
```
